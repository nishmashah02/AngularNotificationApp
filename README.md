Push Notfication Support for AngularJS 1 App


This is AngularJS Cordova Push Notification Implementation for Android and IOS.

Suppport AngularJS 1.

Download the project and Import the necessary Cordova Libraries into Android and IOS platform (To reduce the upload on GitHub . I have excluded cordova library files)

User has to register for Android and IOS FCM and get the TokenID and put it appropriately for Android and IOS push Notification registration.

Thanks Enjoy :)
